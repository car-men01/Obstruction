The game can be played using the text-based interface, or the GUI. It has 5 different board sizes available and 2 difficulties: easy and hard, where the user is playing against the computer.
In easy mode, the computer places random valid moves on the board. In hard mode, the computer generates all possible moves and tries to make the most advantageous move for it, by using the Minimax algorithm.
